            <p class="paragraph">The relationship between the interviewer and interviewee in research settings can have both positive and negative consequences.[19] Their relationship can bring deeper understanding of the information being collected, however this creates a risk that the interviewer will be unable to be unbiased in their collection and interpretation of information.[19] Bias can be created from the interviewers perception of the interviewee, or from the interviewee's perception of the interviewer.[19] Additionally, a researcher can bring biases to the table based on the researcherâ€™s mental state, their preparedness for conducting the research, and the researcher conducting inappropriate interviews.[20] Interviewers can use various practices known in qualitative research to mitigate interviewer bias. These practices include subjectivity, objectivity, and reflexivity. Each of these practices allows the interviewer, or researcher, the opportunity to use their bias to enhance their work by gaining a deeper understanding of the problem they are studying.</p>
